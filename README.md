## 3.2. generate_infographics.py

#### 3.2.1. Refreshing Map URLs
```
-- refresh_maps (yes/no)

python generate_infographics.py --refresh_maps yes
```
Used to generate list of map urls in 'maps/maps.csv'. Needed whenever power league maps change. If not working, check if brawlify website https://brawlify.com/league/ is correctly showing the maps.

#### 3.2.2. Refreshing Map Win Rate Statistics

```
-- refresh_stats (yes/no)

python generate_infographics.py --refresh_stats yes
```
Visits each of the map urls in 'maps/maps.csv' to download the latest win rate data. Saves data to `/maps/brawlers.csv`

#### 3.2.3 Generating Checklist
Ensure that `main.py` is ran to get the most updated brawler statistics for c9 and c6.
